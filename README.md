# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of tic tac toe made with C# to play in console

## Getting started
The console prints out a 3x3 board with number on it (1 to 9)
Each players chooses a spot to mark until one player wins by having a full line (vertical-horizontal-diagonal)

## Potential improvements:
* UI update
* Exception handling for exceeding board's numbers
